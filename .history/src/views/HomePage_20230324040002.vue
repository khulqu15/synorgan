Add the splash screen to your app: Use JavaScript to display the splash screen animation when the app starts up, and hide it after a set period of time. Here's an example using jQuery:
javascript
Copy code
$(document).ready(function() {
  // Display the splash screen
  $('.splash').show();
  
  // Hide the splash screen after 3 seconds
  setTimeout(function() {
    $('.splash').hide();
  }, 3000);
});
Note that you'll need to replace .splash with the class name of the element that contains your logo image and animation. You may also want to add additional styles to center the splash screen and make it fullscreen.

By following these steps, you can create a stylish and professional-looking splash screen animation with an image logo for your app.
